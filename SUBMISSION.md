```powershell
cd main
docker build -t flask-lab-project:latest .
```

#### Run Docker Container
```powershell
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-lab-project:latest
```

#### Verify Container
Open browser and navigate to: **http://localhost:5000/**

#### Stop Container
```powershell
docker ps                          # Find container ID
docker stop <container-id>
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. **Trigger**
- Activates on push to `main` branch
- Activates on pull requests to `main` branch

#### 2. **Setup**
- Runs on: `ubuntu-latest`
- Python version: `3.11`

#### 3. **Test Stage**
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  working-directory: main
  run: pytest -q tests/
```

#### 4. **Build Stage**
```yaml
- name: Build Docker image
  working-directory: main
  run: docker build -t flask-lab-project:latest .
```

#### 5. **Deploy Stage (Optional)**
- Logs into Docker Hub (if credentials configured)
- Tags and pushes image to Docker Hub

### Viewing Pipeline Results

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/ghulam-mujtaba5/flask-lab-project/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. View detailed logs for each step
4. ‚úÖ Green checkmark = Success
5. ‚ùå Red X = Failure (check logs for details)

---

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

### Dockerfile Breakdown

```dockerfile
# Use official Python slim image for smaller size
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy and install dependencies first (layer caching)
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . /app

# Expose Flask port
EXPOSE 5000

# Use gunicorn for production (better than Flask dev server)
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

### Why Gunicorn?
- Production-grade WSGI server
- Better performance than Flask development server
- Handles multiple concurrent requests
- Industry standard for Flask deployments

### Docker Best Practices Implemented
‚úÖ Multi-stage builds (dependencies separate from code)  
‚úÖ Slim base image (smaller attack surface)  
‚úÖ Non-root user (security)  
‚úÖ Layer caching optimization  
‚úÖ Production-ready server (gunicorn)

- [ ] Check all three API endpoints are documented
- [ ] Verify team members section displays correctly

#### Health Check Test
- [ ] Click "Test Health Check" button
- [ ] Verify alert shows "Status: 200" and "Response: OK"

#### Data Endpoint Test
- [ ] Fill in name field (e.g., "John Doe")
- [ ] Fill in message field (e.g., "Hello World")
- [ ] Click "Send Data" button
- [ ] Verify JSON response appears with received data
- [ ] Verify message says "Data processed"

#### API Testing with cURL

**Test Health Endpoint:**

curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Expected: OK
```

**Test Data Endpoint:**
```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/data `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"name":"Test","value":123}'
# Expected: {"received":{"name":"Test","value":123},"message":"Data processed"}
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Port 5000 already in use
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Kill process using port 5000
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```

#### Issue: Docker build fails
**Solution:**
1. Check Docker Desktop is running
2. Verify you're in the `main/` directory
3. Check `requirements.txt` syntax
4. Rebuild with no cache: `docker build --no-cache -t flask-lab-project .`

#### Issue: Tests fail
**Solution:**
1. Activate virtual environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run with verbose: `pytest -v tests/`
4. Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.11+)

#### Issue: CI/CD pipeline fails
**Solution:**
1. Check Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Verify all tests pass locally first
3. Check GitHub Actions syntax in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
4. Ensure paths are correct (working-directory: main)
